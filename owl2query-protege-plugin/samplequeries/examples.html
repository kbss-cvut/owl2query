<p>Here are three query
examples. In the screen shots we show the plug-in integrated in
protege 4.1. The query is drawn in the graph area and it is executed
with the pellet reason. The name of the file that is currently
associated with the query is shown in the title at the top of the
tab. The tool bar under it contains tools as : demo query , new query
, open query, save query, switch between graph and SPARQL view, undo
and redo graph changes. On the next line in the GUI we have a split
view that contains on the left prefix editor and on the right a tab
view with var editor and layout editor. Under this view there is the
graph area. On the right side of the graph area we can see a node
editor. Under the graph is a serialization of the query in SPARQL-DL
syntax. Last row in the GUI is the result area with a run button and
a result table. On the right of the screen-shots we can see other
protege views. They are present to show selection integration between
the plug-in and other parts of protege.</p>

<p><B>Example 1</B><p>
<p>The first query is used
to find all the graduate students that are related to a course and
find what kind of relationship. It is a mixed ABox Rbox query. In
SPARQL-DL this query is written in using two type atoms and
a property value atom: 
<p>
<p>Q(z, y, x) :-<p>
<p>PropertyValue(?y, ?x,
?z),<p>
<p>Type(&lt;Course&gt;, ?z),<p>
<p>Type(&lt;GraduateStudent&gt;,
?x).<p>
<p><BR>
<p>
<p><IMG SRC="queryexamples/sparqlexampl1.PNG" ALT="example1" BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>
<p>
<p>In the graph in the ABox
area we have the property value query atom. It is represented using
two ABox nodes for the subject and object of the property and an
arrow that goes through the property node witch represents the
property it self. Arrows with &quot;type&quot; stereotype to a TBox
nodes in the TBox area represent the type atoms in the query. The red
color represents a variable. The yellow color is used to represent
constants. Selection GraduateStudent97 in the result table is update
also in the protege. On the right in the protege's Idividuals view we
can see that individual GraduateStudent97 is also selected. 
<p>
<p><BR>
<p>
<p><B>Example2</B><p>
<p>This query is used to
find all the students who are also employees and find what kind of
employee. This is a mixed ABox TBox query. In SPARQL-DL the query is
represented with two type atoms and one sub class of atom:<p>
<p>Q(C, x) :-<p>
<p>Type(?C, ?x),<p>
<p>T(&lt;Student&gt;, ?x),<p>
<p>SubClassOf(?C,
&lt;Employee&gt;).<p>
<p><BR>
<p>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><IMG SRC="queryexamples/sparqlexampl2.PNG" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>
<p>
<p>As in the first example
the type atoms are represented as arrows from a ABox node to a TBox
node with a &quot;type&quot; stereotype. The Subclass atom is
represented as an arrow from the variable TBox node to a constant
TBox node with stereotype &quot;SubClassOf&quot;. Note column
selection in the result table is the same as the selection in the
graph and the variable editor.<p>
<p><BR>
<p>
<p><B>Example3</B><p>
<p>This query is used to
find all the members of Depatment0 and what kind of membership. This
is a mixed ABox RBox query as the first example, but this time we add
constraints to the property node in the RBox area. In SPARQL-DL the
query has one type atom, one property value atom and one sub property
atom:<p>
<p>Q(y, x) :-<p>
<p>SubPropertyOf(?y,
&lt;memberOf&gt;),<p>
<p>PropertyValue(?y,?x,&lt;Department0&gt;),<p>
<p>Type(&lt;Person&gt;, ?x).<p>
<p><BR>
<p>
<p><IMG SRC="queryexamples/sparqlexampl3.PNG" NAME="obrázky3" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>
<p>
<p>In the graph the sub
property of atom is represented as an arrow between two rbox nodes in
the RBox area with a &quot;SubPropertyOf&quot; stereotype. This graph
has two nodes that contain the label representing the variable y.
This means that the nodes reference the same term from different
parts of the query. This fact is represented in the graph
interactively. When the user tries to interact with the node the
node's borders that reference the same term are emphasized. Also a
dashed line drawn to the other nodes using the same term.<p>
